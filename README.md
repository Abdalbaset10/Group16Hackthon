#Group 16 project :
intro :

in this project we build an app to associate the online education system 
this app is built for three types of users {Manager wich is an idefined user , teachers and students},
of course as three users means different level of premmisions , as a manager he can {Make announcement , Delete user , promote others "will be explained in teacher section" ,
create class schedual ,and change things in his profile }
teahcers sign up as normal user (Student) and then they got promoted to be a teacher by the manager wich gives them their own premmisions {uploading assignment,'
changing things in their profile , remove student from class , checking presense of student , sending and recieving messages from students}
as student u can't have these premmisions , they can {submit assignment, messaging teacher,see their schedual}

This app has been build on agile's methods it may contain some glitches and unpredictable problems as result of the deadline to be submitted on , for that you can 
message the develper on his email if it's and emergency {moradte@ac.sce.ac.il} or on the report button explaining the problem and we will try to fix it ASAP,
